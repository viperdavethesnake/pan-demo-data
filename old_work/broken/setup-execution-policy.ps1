# setup-execution-policy.ps1
# --- PowerShell Execution Policy Setup for Script Deployment ---
# 
# PURPOSE:
#   Configures PowerShell execution policy on new file servers to allow
#   the Panzura Symphony test environment scripts to run properly.
#
# PROBLEM:
#   When copying scripts to new servers, PowerShell's security settings
#   prevent unsigned scripts from running with errors like:
#   - "execution of scripts is disabled on this system"
#   - "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled" 
#   - "digital signature" or "signing" errors
#
# SOLUTION:
#   Sets execution policy to RemoteSigned which allows:
#   - Local scripts to run (our test environment scripts)
#   - Downloaded scripts require digital signatures (maintains security)
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this script to new file server
#   2. Run PowerShell as Administrator
#   3. Execute: .\setup-execution-policy.ps1
#   4. Then run other scripts normally:
#      - .\create-folders.ps1 -ThrottleLimit 16
#      - .\create-files.ps1 -FileCount 100000
#
# NOTES:
#   - This is a one-time setup per server
#   - RemoteSigned balances functionality with security
#   - Alternative: Use "Unrestricted" for maximum compatibility
#   - Use "Bypass -Scope Process" for temporary/single-session only
